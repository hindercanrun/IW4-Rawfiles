localize,An error occurred while reading the stats data. Your stats have been reset.
localize,Gain XP! You get experience points(XP) for getting kills, completing challenges, and completing matches on Ranked servers.
localize,Level up! As you gain XP, you earn promotions, unlockables, and new challenges.
localize,Customize your weapon! You can add a camouflage pattern or attachment to your weapons in Create-a-class.
localize,Design your own class! Create-a-class lets you choose your weapons and perks, then name the class to your liking.
localize,Use teamwork! If you damage an enemy but someone else gets the kill, you are awarded assist points.
localize,Get hardcore.  Hardcore modes remove your hud and make weapons even more deadly.
localize,Custom games!  Unranked games can play any game mode with custom rules.
localize,Challenges are rewarding.  Weapon challenges unlock attachments and camouflage patterns for use in Create-a-class.
localize,Get more XP!  You get extra XP bonuses for completing Challenges, located in Rank and Challenges.
localize,Listen in... You can hear the enemy team's voice chat with the Eavesdrop perk.
localize,Be aware... You can spot enemy explosive devices like claymores and C4 with the Bomb Squad perk.
localize,Take a stand!  Pull out your pistol and make that last ditch effort to get some kills before you die with the Last Stand perk.
localize,Combine your air support!  Call in an airstrike in combination with a UAV for a pinpoint accurate carpet bomb.
localize,Chopper down!  Don't be afraid to fire at enemy choppers with your primary weapon.  It may do less damage than a rocket, but it definitely hurts.
localize,Find the enemy!  Calling in a UAV shows enemies on your radar as red dots.  Knowing the enemy position is a big advantage.
localize,Defend your flags!  In the Domination game mode, holding marked objectives gives your team points.  The more objectives you hold, the more points you get.
localize,Watch those corners!  Be careful playing Search and Destroy - when you die you don't respawn.
localize,Escort the bomb!  Protect the bomb carrier in Sabotage.  It takes teamwork to get to the enemy objective.
localize,Call in radar!  You can earn radar for you and your team by getting 3 kills in a row without dying.
localize,Call in an airstrike!  Get 5 kills in a row without dying and you can call in an air strike on the position of your choice.
localize,Call in a chopper!  You can earn helicopter air support by getting 7 kills in a row without dying.
localize,Back to basics... The Old School game modes don't have classes.  Everyone starts with the same weapons and must pick up new weapons and perks in the level.
localize,Pick your shots!  When you fire a weapon WITHOUT a silencer, you appear as a red dot on your enemies' compass.
localize,Get quiet...  Using a silencer doesn't show your shots as a red dot on the enemy compass, but your weapon's range is reduced.
localize,Stealth technology.  Using the UAV Jammer perk will prevent you from showing as a red dot on the enemy compass.
localize,Grenades from a rifle mounted grenade launcher need to travel before they are armed.  They do damage if they hit your enemy, but only explode at a distance.
localize,Create your own game mode!  Start your own server and tweak game mode settings to whatever you like.
localize,Dominate with teamwork!  Domination flags capture faster with multiple teammates capturing together.
localize,Use your knife!  Melee the enemy with your knife for a fast and humiliating kill.
localize,Run faster!  Pressing sprint will allow you to run faster for a short amount of time, but you can't use your weapon.
localize,Hold your breath!  Hold your breath with scoped weapons for increased accuracy.
localize,Throw back grenades!  Look for the grenade throwback icon when a grenade is near you.  You can throw back the enemy's grenades.
localize,Shoot through walls!  Different weapons can fire through many different surfaces with reduced damage.
localize,Use your inventory!  Items like grenade launchers, RPGs, claymores, and C4 are stored in your inventory.
localize,Explosive shortcut!  Double tap the use key to detonate thrown C4 while using another weapon.
localize,You have not chosen a profile yet.
