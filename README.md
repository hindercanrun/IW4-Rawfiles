# Another dump?
Yes, this is just another IW4 dump. But with a bit of a catch. This dump also includes SP weapon files, all SP and MP ,ENT files, as well as GSC and .ENT of the new maps that where included in IW4y (for those people who don't know how to open an IWD file).

# Why are most of the menu files broken?
Sadly, there are only two public dumps of menu files, and both of them have their own issues. I will try my best to fix ALL of them, but that is not a promise.
